## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

##Instuctions on how to play the game.
1.It is a simple memory card game. 
2.There are 8 different face cards. We have 2 of each type.
3.When you click & open any card in the 1st try, you need to find same face card on the next try.
4.If you didn't get the same face cards then both the cards will close.
5.If you get the same card in next try,then both the cards remain open.
6.You need to match all the 16 cards then only you win the game.
7.There are infinite no. of tries for matching the cards.
8.If the no. of tries are really high then your star rating will come down.
9. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the restart button.
